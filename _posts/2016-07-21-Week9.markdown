Journal Entry (Thursday/Friday)
- After profiling and noticing that using the `Polynomials` package for computing $\gamma*_i$ is a significant part of the runtime of `ode113`, I realized that I only needed to compute $\gamma*_i$ for i = 1:16! I precalculated these, and have these values hard coded into the algorithm, which lead to an significant decrease in runtime. 
- I also used ProfileView to determine which version of array assignments is quicker: in-place or out-of-place. Contrary to what we expected, in-place took longer and more memory.
