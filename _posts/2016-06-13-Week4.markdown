###Up-to-date plan for the week
1. (Monday) Main goal: Find out why `ode_ab_adaptive` is performing poorly
  + Get `plei.jl` example fully functional, and compare performance of `ode_ab_adaptive` against RK methods (PLEI is a test case where function evaluations are expensive, which is where the AB methods are preferred. See Hairer pg 427)
  + Skype about performance results and seek advice as to where the issues may be
  + Continue debugging `ode_ab_adaptive` and also make switch to us `make_consisent_types()` function
  + Have all IVPTestSuite feature branches ready for merging. First merge `m3/meta-gone`, then `ob/plei` and `ob/pyplot.`
2. (Tuesday) Main goal: Optimize `ode_ab_adaptive`; Merge IVPTestSuite feature branches
  + Continue to try to reduce memory usage of `ode_ab_adaptive`
  + Merge feature branches of IVPTestSuite into master
  + Add another testcase to IVPTestSuite which has a high cost of function evaluations, which is where AB methods are most useful
  + Start work on a presentation slides/poster for JuliaCon and CAARMS
3. (Wednesday) Main goal: Collect data on performance; start preparing demonstration and documentations for new solver and IVPTestSuite workflow
  + Run comparison plots for different solvers against `ode_ab_adaptive`
  + Document performance test "workflow" so that users can easily test solvers
  + Using above documentation, post results of pwl's PR 
  + Continue work no a presentation slides/poster for JuliaCon and CAARMS
4. (Thursday) Main goal: Prepare for JuliCon; Continue adding new documentation for ODE.jl and IVPTestSuite.jl
  + Add Julia Notebook of new solver on PLEI testcase
  + Finish detailing IVPTestSuite workflow documentation, especially for new solvers (not yet in ODE.jl) and PR of ODE.jl
  + Look more into BenchmarkTools.jl for tomorrow's Skype call;
5. (Friday) Main goal: Prepare for JuliaCon; Look into BenchmarkTools.jl and wrapping other solvers
  + Skype call with Mauro about JuliaCon statergy
    - What to do about BenchmarkTools.jl
    - Discuss my proposed presentation approach
    - Discuss if there are other ODE.jl members I should meet with (and maybe discuss pwl's PR with)
    - Discuss if there are any developers of other ODE solvers whom I should talk, especially those who developed solvers we may include in IVPTestSuite. 
  + Explore wha
6. (Saturday-Sunday)Main goal: Prepare for JuliaCon; Tidy up `ode_ab_adaptive` and IVPTestSuite.jl
  + Focus on stylistic changes to make sure code is consistent with rest of ODE.jl release
  + Continue preparing JuliaCon presentation
