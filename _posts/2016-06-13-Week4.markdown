###Up-to-date plan for the week
1. (Monday) Main goal: Tidying up IVPTestSuite.jl
  + ~~Work towards getting `plei.jl` example fully functional, and compare performance of `ode_ab_adaptive` against RK methods (PLEI is a test case where function evaluations are expensive, which is where the AB methods are preferred. See Hairer pg 427)~~
  + ~~Skype about performance results and seek advice as to where the issues may be~~
  + ~~Have all IVPTestSuite feature branches ready for merging. First merge `m3/meta-gone`, then `ob/plei` and `ob/pyplot.`~~
2. (Tuesday) Main goal: Merge IVPTestSuite feature branches
  + ~~Finish getting `plei.jl` functional~~
  + ~~Merge the IVPTestSuite branch ob/plei into master~~
  + ~~Then ob/pyplot into master ~~
3. (Wednesday) Main goal: Collect data on performance and continue debugging
  + ~~Run comparison plots for different solvers against `ode_ab_adaptive`~~
  + Experiment with fixed step AB and Runge-Kutta methods, to compare performance when the same `tspan` is used
4. (Thursday) Main goal: Start preparing for JuliCon; continue to improve `ode_ab_adaptive`'s performance
  + 
  + Add Julia Notebook of new solver on PLEI testcase
  + Look more into BenchmarkTools.jl for tomorrow's Skype call;
5. (Friday) Main goal: Prepare for JuliaCon; Look into BenchmarkTools.jl and wrapping other solvers;  start preparing demonstration and documentations for new solver and IVPTestSuite workflow
  + Skype call with Mauro about JuliaCon statergy
    - What to do about BenchmarkTools.jl
    - Discuss my proposed presentation approach
    - Discuss if there are other ODE.jl members I should meet with (and maybe discuss pwl's PR with)
    - Discuss if there are any developers of other ODE solvers whom I should talk, especially those who developed solvers we may include in IVPTestSuite. 
6. (Saturday-Sunday)Main goal: Prepare for JuliaCon; Tidy up `ode_ab_adaptive` and IVPTestSuite.jl
  + Focus on stylistic changes to make sure code is consistent with rest of ODE.jl release
  + Continue preparing JuliaCon presentation
  + make switch to us `make_consisent_types()` function in `ode_ab_adaptive`
  + Add another testcase to IVPTestSuite which has a high cost of function evaluations, which is where AB methods are most useful
  + Document performance test "workflow" so that users can easily test solvers
  + Using above documentation, post results of pwl's PR 

Journal Entry #16
+ Today I learned even more about git, and did several rebasings and squashings. Now, IVPTestSuite has metaprogramming gone, and there is a pull request to include the PLEI testcase, which is just one commit. Further the ob/pyplot2 branch which is based on ob/plei, which is just one commit ahead of ob/plei. 
+ Unfornately, I wasn't able to get to the bottom of what if causing the PLEI testcase to break. I plan on running some plots tomorrow, to make sure that it is not the case the the reference solution is incorrect. Though, there is likely a small bug somewhere. In fact, I found on small bug, though there is likely another somewhere.
+ Overall, after the PLEI test case is working, we can merge with master, than subsequently, merge ob/pyplot2, in which case there will be just the master branch of IVPTestSuite. I plan to have this all done by lunch tomorrow. Then, the singular focus for the rest of the week is making the VSVO AB solver correct.
